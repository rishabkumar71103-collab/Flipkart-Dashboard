The Flipkart Sales Analysis Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of e-commerce sales performance through interactive and data-driven insights. Built using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, this project highlights key business metrics such as total sales, profit, discount impact, and customer ratings across multiple product categories and regions.

In Excel, the dataset was cleaned and structured using advanced formulas, pivot tables, and data validation techniques. This ensured accurate and consistent data before transferring it to Power BI. Using Power Query, the data was transformed, and DAX formulas were applied to calculate important KPIs like total revenue, profit margin, and average customer rating.

The Power BI Dashboard features dynamic slicers for category, city, and payment mode, allowing users to filter and analyze data easily. Visual elements such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs make it simple to compare performance and spot patterns over time.

Key highlights include identifying top-selling categories, understanding the effect of discounts on profit, analyzing gender-based purchase trends, and determining the most preferred payment methods.
This project demonstrates strong analytical, visualization, and storytelling skills essential for a Data Analyst, enabling businesses to make smarter, insight-driven decisions.
